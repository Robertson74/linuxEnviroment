API Method: order_find

 

The order_find method is an extremely powerful reporting engine to find orders and get a result of order Ids that meet your criteria. HTTPS is required for this call.

Sometimes you may be looking for a particular order that matches a few criteria, but not necessarily requiring that ALL the criteria are met and other times you want to narrow down your search where you want each criteria in your search to only give you orders that have the exact match.

 

That is why we created two different modes of searching using the search_type parameter of "any" (match) or "all".

 

For example, if you wanted to find all the new orders that had an RMA as well as had upsells, you would pass:

 

method=order_find&start_date=10/05/2009&end_date=10/05/2010&campaign_id=1&criteria=new,rma,has_upsells&search_type=all

 

The response would be something like the following:

 

response_code=100&total_orders=1&order_ids=15351

 

But if you change the search type to any, then your criteria will have widened because this will give you orders that have RMA, but are also NEW and also have upsells :

 

response_code=100&total_orders=17&order_ids=15339,15342,15345,15346,15347,15348,15349,15350,15351,15352,15353,15354,15355,15356,15359,15360,15361

We also allow a wildcard search in criteria fields tracking_num, affiliate_id, sub_affiliate_id, first_name, last_name, address, city, state, zip, phone, email and ip_address.  This would allow you to do something like this:

 

For instance, you are interested in orders on your first recurring cycle from a person named "Dave" who you know has a gmail email address, who also resides in Michigan, and whose order has been refunded.  You could pass:

 

method=order_find&start_date=10/05/2009&end_date=10/05/2010&campaign_id=1&criteria= first_name=dav*,all_refunds,state=mi,email=*gmail*,billing_cycle=1&search_type=all

Notice when you enter in your criteria, each additional filter will be another comma delimited search criteria.  Additionally when a value is needed you will pass "field_name"="your search value".

 

By default if you are just looking to get all the orders off a campaign you must at least pass &criteria=all& in your query string.

 

Other required parameters to this call are campaign_id and start_date and end_date.

 

An optional parameter, return_type, may be passed. If return_type is sent as ”order_view”, in addition to the normal return parameters you will also receive a “data” parameter that contains a JSON (http://www.json.org/) encoded object of the data returned by the order_view method for each order returned by the query.

 

method=order_find&start_date=10/05/2009&end_date=10/05/2010&campaign_id=1&criteria= first_name=dav* &search_type=all&return_type=order_view

 

response_code=100&total_orders=1&order_ids=10001,10002&data={"10001":{<order_view return values>,"10002":{<order_view return values>}}

 

See the order_view definition for return values.

If the value you are passing has one or more commas (,) as part of the value, you must escape this string by surrounding it with double quotes(“).

 

For example, if the desired billing address is :

 

123 Main Street, Apt 201

API Method: subscription_update

 

The subscription_update method is used to update the subscription status of an order subscription chain using a unique identifier – subscription_id - for the entire chain, rather than an order_id.

 

This method accepts requests in two formats. The first is the standard HTTP POST with a CSV pairing of values and actions. The second option is to send a JSON encoded string as the “subscription_update” parameter, with the following format:

 

{“$ACTION” : {“$SUBSCRIPTION_ID_1” : [$ATTRIBUTES]”,”SUBSCRIPTION_ID_2”:[$ATTRIBUTES]}}

$ATTRIBUTES is an empty array, but will be used in the response back.

 

Example:

 

{"start":{"8610286a4311c82d5275676a91ce610e" : [],"4b610f992c9b76edaaa2fd76697784a3":[]},"stop":{"c70bef335b6f01a69a141f978ec8ab7f" : []}}

This example would start two subscriptions, and stop the third, if applicable.

 

The output for this method follows the same JSON format, adding an additional value to the subscription_id attributes array with the response code for the action taken.

 

Using above example input:

 

{"start":{"8610286a4311c82d5275676a91ce610e":{"response":"100"},"4b610f992c9b76edaaa2fd76697784a3":{"response":"353"}},"stop":{"c70bef335b6f01a69a141f978ec8ab7f" : {"response":"100"}}}

**Product attributes can be built several ways. HTML bracket syntax for arrays is sampled below as a <select> field. cURL requests can also be simulated to provide the data to LimeLight. IDs can be obtained by calling the product_attribute_index method of the membership API.

 

Option 1: Text values

<select name=”product_attribute[1][Color]”>

  <option value=”Red”>Red</option>

  <option value=”Blue”>Blue</option>

</select>

Option 2: Numeric ids

<select name=”product_attribute[1][123]”>

  <option value=”124”>Red</option>

  <option value=”125”>Blue</option>

</select>

 

Option 3: cURL request (in PHP)

// Multiple products with attributes. Showing both text and numeric attribute/option representations

$attr = array(

            ‘1’ = array(

                        ‘Color’ => ‘Red’

            ),

            ‘2’ = array(

                        ‘123’ => ‘124’

            )

);

// Assign to ‘product_attribute’ key

$data[‘product_attribute’] = $attr;

 

// Important; http_build_query is required for cURL to properly parse the data as an array

curl_setopt($cs, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, http_build_query($data));
