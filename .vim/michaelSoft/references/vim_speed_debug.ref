You can use built-in profiling support: after launching vim do

:profile start profile.log
:profile func *
:profile file *
" At this point do slow actions
:profile pause
:noautocmd qall!
(unlike quitting noautocmd is not really required, it just makes vim quit faster).

Note: you wonâ€™t get information about functions there were deleted before vim quit.
